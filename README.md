# Amazon Prime Scope (JP)

This is a Google Chrome extension.  
It can be used on any Chromium-based browser that supports installing extensions from the Chrome Web Store.

## What can it do?

With one click, this filters Amazon search results to show only items sold by Amazon and all Prime-eligible products. This is useful when you want to purchase reliable products, such as expensive items, rare goods, or durable products.  
However, it cannot prevent item swaps at Amazon warehouses.
